  <h1>Declipping</h1>
  <p>(TODO: Write better words) This website allows you to declip audio. Clipping is a recording artifact
     which occurs when a microphone is recording at a higher volume level than
     it can handle. The correct amplitude cannot correctly be represented, and
     instead the recording amplitude is reduced to a value very near the maximum
     allowed value. The effect produced sounds a lot like distortion, although 
     in this case, it is not pleasant or wanted. One example of a recording 
     scenario where clipping is likely is when recording live concerts through
     mobile phones. </p>

     will be declipped, and an improved version will be downloaded to your
     computer. chchch</p>
